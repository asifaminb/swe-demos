            <p>The patient's approved mode of transport for the travel subsidy is determined by the most clinically appropriate and cost-effective mode of transport available. Modes of transport can include private motor vehicle (driving), bus, train, ferry or airplane.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, the approved mode of transport may be different for the forward and return journeys.</p><p>Hospital or health facilities will consider the individual circumstances of the patient when determining the approved mode of transport for the travel subsidy.</p><p>The mode of transport is approved by the local public hospital or health facility in line with the <a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0033/848706/qh-hsdgdl-050-2.pdf">PTSS Guideline</a>.</p><h3>Subsidy amounts</h3><p>Travel subsidies are calculated using the rates below:</p><table id="table49530"><thead><tr><th id="table49530r1c1"> Mode of transport</th><th id="table49530r1c2"> Subsidy amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td headers="table49530r1c1">

            <p>The PTSS accommodation subsidy provides financial support for accommodation costs for as long as the patient is medically required to be away from home. Patients who need to relocate for treatment are still eligible for PTSS and should speak with their local hospital or health facility about long-term accommodation options.</p><div class="example"><p><strong>For Example:</strong></p><p>Scott and his son Rodney are temporarily relocating to Brisbane for Rodney&rsquo;s Leukaemia treatment. As Rodney is under 18 years of age, he is automatically approved for an escort.</p><p>Rodney&rsquo;s PTSS application has been approved for travel, accommodation and escort subsidies.</p><p>The end date for Rodney&rsquo;s treatment is unknown so his local hospital has booked both Scott and Rodney a one-way airplane ticket to Brisbane.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott has organised accommodation with a local Non-Government Organisation (NGO) that will directly invoice his local hospital for the same amount as his approved subsidy.</p><p>As Scott and Rodney&rsquo;s airfares have been paid for by their local hospital, and the NGO accommodation provider invoices the local hospital directly, they will not receive a PTSS subsidy payment, as they have not incurred any travel or accommodation costs.</p><p>To continue to have their accommodation paid for, Scott will need to provide evidence of Rodney's ongoing treatment in Brisbane.</p><p>When Rodney receives medical clearance to return home, Scott will need to speak with someone from the Brisbane facility about contacting his local hospital to arrange their travel home under PTSS.</p></div><p>Where a return journey cannot reasonably be completed in one day, for example, driving for longer than eight hours or for more than 600kms, where the patient has an early or late appointment time they may also be eligible for the accommodation subsidy.</p><p>The accommodation subsidy is available if patients chose to stay in paid commercial accommodation or with family or friends.</p><p>Any time the patient stays in hospital as an in-patient is not included in the patient&rsquo;s accommodation subsidy. Approved escorts may still be eligible for their accommodation subsidy during that time.</p><div class="example"><p><strong>For Example:</strong></p><p><em>Esme is travelling for a knee replacement surgery and her local facility has approved her for travel, accommodation and escort subsidies. </em></p><p><em>For her treatment, Esme will be away from home for a total of seven nights, three of which she will spend in hospital as an inpatient. Esme has a Pensioner Concession Card so does not need to pay for the first four nights of accommodation for herself or her escort. </em></p><p><em>Esme has been approved for air travel and has booked the return airfares for herself and her escort Bill. She has also booked a hotel for $130 per night for the seven nights she will be away from home.</em></p><p><em>Esme and Bill will receive the following subsidy payments:</em></p><p><strong><em>Travel subsidy</em></strong></p><p><em>Both Esme and Bill will have the cost of their return economy airfares, minus any GST and booking fees, fully reimbursed in their travel subsidy payment. </em></p><p><strong><em>Accommodation subsidy</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Esme: $240 </em></strong><em>($60 per night for the four nights she is <u>not</u> an inpatient).</em></p><p><strong><em>Bill: $420</em></strong><em> ($60 per night for the seven nights Esme needs to be away from home for treatment). </em></p><p><strong><em>Total accommodation subsidy payment: $660</em></strong><em> ($240 for Esme and $420 for Bill).</em></p><p><em>Esme and Bill will need to pay the additional costs for their seven nights&rsquo; accommodation.</em></p><p><em>The total costs of Esme and Bill&rsquo;s accommodation for the seven nights&rsquo; is $910 ($130 x 6). </em></p><p><em>Esme and Bill will need to pay the extra cost of $250 ($910 - $660) for their accommodation.</em></p></div><h3>Subsidy amounts</h3><p>Accommodation subsidy payments are calculated using the amounts below:</p><table id="table10157"><thead><tr><th id="table10157r1c1"> Type of accommodation</th><th id="table10157r1c2"> Subsidy amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td headers="table10157r1c1">

            <p>Patients eligible for PTSS can apply for an escort to travel with them.</p><p>An escort is someone who accompanies the patient when travelling to access specialist medical treatment. This can be to assist them in their treatment, as an active carer or if the patient is impaired. An escort must be 18 years or older.</p><p>Patients should discuss their need for an escort with their referring clinician and the staff at their local travel office when they submit their application.</p><p>If the patient's clinician makes a recommendation for an escort, the local hospital or health facility will assess the request based on the eligibility criteria in the PTSS Guideline and the information the patient provided in their application.</p><p>Escorts are approved by the local hospital or health facility in line with the <a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0033/848706/qh-hsdgdl-050-2.pdf">PTSS Guideline</a>.</p><p>Patients are eligible for an escort if they:</p><ul><li>Are a minor (under 18 years of age) or a dependent child.</li><li>Have a legal guardian who is required to make decisions regarding their healthcare.</li><li>Need assistance, for example, they require oxygen or sedation, are frail or elderly.</li><li>Have a life-threatening condition and/or need life-saving treatment.</li><li>Need someone to assist them with their treatment or rehabilitation, for example, they are undergoing major surgery, an organ transplant or renal dialysis and need a family member to help them at home.</li><li>Have a physical or cognitive impairment (e.g. brain injury or dementia), visual impairment, mental illness or where their mobility is impaired.</li></ul><p>Unless otherwise approved, escorts are required to travel with the patient to be eligible for a subsidy. Only one travel subsidy is paid for private motor vehicle when a patient and escort travel together.</p><p>Travel and accommodation subsidies for approved escorts will be determined based on the PTSS eligibility criteria.</p>
